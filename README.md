As an ex-BINFO-student, I made an app that encompasses several components designed to enhance the experience of new BINFO students at the university. It features a captivating snake game that provides a classic and addictive arcade-style entertainment. Additionally, a comprehensive map component aids in navigating the campus by displaying the locations of various university buildings, helping students find their way around with ease. A gallery component showcases images of the various university buildings, offering a glimpse into the campus environment. Furthermore, a history slide show takes students on a journey through the university's architectural heritage, providing a deeper understanding of its evolution and cultural significance. Lastly, a tailored quiz component tests new BINFO students' knowledge of their program, including details such as the number of semesters, ECTS requirements, and key personnel. Together, these components create an engaging and informative app that supports new students in their transition to university life.

Quiz :

As an ex BINFO student , i made the quiz component in the app specifically tailored for new BINFO (Bachelor of Informatics) students and aims to test their knowledge about the program and its various aspects. This interactive feature presents a series of multiple-choice questions related to important details such as the number of semesters, ECTS requirements, head teacher, secretary information, and more. By challenging students to recall and apply their understanding of the BINFO program, the quiz component serves as a valuable tool for self-assessment and reinforcement of key information.

History : 

The history slide show component in the app provides new students with a journey through the rich heritage and evolution of the university. By leveraging a combination of images and text, this feature allows students to delve into the historical significance and background of the campus. The slide show offers a chronological narrative, guiding students through the architectural milestones, renovations, and expansions that have shaped the university over time. 

Gallery :

The gallery component in the app offers an exciting visual experience for new students by showcasing a collection of pictures featuring the various university buildings. This feature allows students to explore and familiarize themselves with the campus architecture, facilities, and landmarks before they even set foot on the grounds


Map :

The map component in the app provides a valuable resource for new students by displaying the locations of various university buildings. Designed to assist with navigation and orientation, this feature offers a user-friendly interface that allows students to easily locate and identify key buildings on campus. Whether it's finding academic buildings, libraries, administrative offices, or student services centers, the map provides a clear visual representation of the campus layout. It can include interactive elements, such as zooming and panning, to enhance the user experience. By utilizing this map component, new students can efficiently plan their routes, save time, and familiarize themselves with the university's infrastructure, ensuring a smooth and successful transition into their academic journey.

Snakey : 

The snake game component is a classic and engaging arcade-style game. In thisstraightforward game, players take control of a pixelated snake, navigating it across a playing field. The objective is to guide the snake to consume food items scattered throughout the area, which causes the snake to grow longer with each meal. However, players must exercise caution to avoid colliding with the walls, as such collision will result in a game over. As the snake grows longer, maneuvering becomes progressively challenging, requiring strategic planning and quick reflexes to achieve high scores. With its intuitive controls and nostalgic charm, the snake game offers endless entertainment and an opportunity to test one's skills in a fun environment.
